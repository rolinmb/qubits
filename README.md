Classical hardware (CPU) simulations of a Qubits, Qutrits, Qudits, and attempts at Quantum Register simulations in various programming languages.

Check out my py-qregister repo for my most recent iteration in python. I also recently retried in C#.

TODO:
- recently updated src/py/qregister.py with help of ChatGPT, however still don't believe the implementation of QuantumRegister is accurate in most languages here. My implementation in C# and in my py-qregister repo feels like the most accurate but I would like the opinion of others.
- verify bloch spehere coordinate representations are accurate for Qubits in all languages. (I tried in python first based on wikipedia)
